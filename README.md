## TL;DR

Originally forked this project for personal use and I didn't mention the creator just because I am planning to rebuild everything.
Currently I switched the project from CRA to Vite, also moved to Typescript, and rewritten all personal info. 

But in case you want to support the initial author, I leave this button
